# TeamFortress Scripts
This is a repository of all the TeamFortress scripts, which was a server I made a few years back using Skript, a server plugin.

Feel free to take anything and make your own server, though definitely credit me. 
These scripts are kinda optimized, but I wouldn't count on it to run well on a free minehut server with any more than maybe 5 players.
Also, it used a very old version of Skript, so you'd have to do some rewriting to get it to work.

Note that the original TeamFortress is still up and playable, this is just now public for others to use.

Here's a list of every plugin that was on the server before it was abandoned, with their respective version numbers if I know them:
- Holographic Displays 3.0
- IllegalStack
